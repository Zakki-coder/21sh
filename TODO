When comparing stderr just take everything after bash: and 21sh:
semicolon
Sometimes after command does not print prompt before nl is given again
Redir should not fork. cd - > lol
Something has broken, after command sometimes waits for newline before printing prompt
Error managment for redir, input redri` open fails if no existing file
Root leak with redir
Root leak with any command
