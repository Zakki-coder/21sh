Something has broken, after command sometimes waits for newline before printing prompt
Why does this work: 0>&- >&- > lol ls ; cat lol //Something weird in order of redirs?

semicolon
Sometimes after command does not print prompt before nl is given again(PROBABLY FIXED, CAUSED BY NO WAIT AFTER FORK"
Error managment for redir, input redri` open fails if no existing file
