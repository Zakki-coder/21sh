ls -l | head -n 5 | tail -n 2 >>>lol leak
Maybe leaks with redir and aggregation without target
Test leaks with: ls >>>lol
echo "Testing redirections," > /tmp/test.txt;echo "with multiple lines" >> /tmp/test.txt;cat /tmp/test.txt;wc -c < tmp/test.txt;rm /tmp/test.txt 2>/dev/null
cat < file
cat -e
rm nosuchfile 2>&1 | cat -e
Problem with redirs is that the linked list is not advanced correctly before adding to the child of last
>&- >&- >lol
Problems of thursday:
>&- ; echo stdout //FIXD
cd /dev/fd;/bin/pwd
echo "It works" //Does not remove quotes
cd - //???
Do heredoc

If u have the interest: >lol echo hi >lmao mom
Something has broken, after command sometimes waits for newline before printing prompt
Why does this work: 0>&- >&- > lol ls ; cat lol //Something weird in order of redirs?
When comparing stderr just take everything after bash: and 21sh:
semicolon
Sometimes after command does not print prompt before nl is given again(PROBABLY FIXED, CAUSED BY NO WAIT AFTER FORK"
Error managment for redir, input redri` open fails if no existing file
Root leak with redir
Root leak with any command
